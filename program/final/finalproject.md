## Connecting the dots

You might think at the early stages of the course, that you will not be able to create what you have in mind for your final. This is a normal, because you still haven't connected the dots. It will happen gradually. It will feel like a gravitational force pulling to condense your disperse knowledge, in orbit with no apparent relationship. There is a always a moment in the project when you find out that all the skills that you've learned during the different weeks, start to come closer. At the beginning they form a blurred image of your idea and bit by bit they will become a very precise shape. Connecting the dots is what has led you to the place where you are now.

## The one (wo)man orchestra

You will need to be multidisciplinary. You need to be able to learn fast and efficiently. You need to be able to observe. You also need to be an exceptional communicator. You're going to be writing detailed documentation explaining people why things are the way they are and why it should be the way it is. You need to be able to express yourself graphically as well. You should be good at sketching early stage designs on paper. You should be reasonably fluent in 2d and 3D design or some other tool for expressing yourself graphically. You need to be a little bit of a developer and, kind of a marketing person as well. Because you're always having to sell the thing that you're offering. 

> **Advice:** During the weeks, don't waste your precious, short time. Learn as much as you can.

## Just in case no one told you: You will never finish

From the very beginning of the project, you have to be aware that **there is no way** you're going to be able to get everything done. No matter how small the project seems, no matter how much time you have. You are **never** going to get done what you though you were going to get done at the beginning. Ever.

> **Learn by doing:** In front of the mirror, repeat 10 times every morning: *I will never finish my final project*

And you have to know from the beginning what is important and what is not. What is the goal of this project? What is **the one thing** that it has to do or it won't be successful? And recognize that you may have to let just about everything else slide. So you've got to **set your priorities very early**.

> **Learn by doing:** What is the one -and only one- thing that the project has to do to be successful? Set your priorities and enjoy crossing them out as times gets close to zero.

That lead us to the next point:

## KISS principle

There is something that I didn't even realize when I started looking for final project ideas. And I think this is true for most people. Every awesome final project that I had seen was simple. Very simple.

The [KISS principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle) will help you when you start freaking out with ridiculous and useless ideas of final projects that no one would ever need.

## Go / No-Go point

There are people who know what final project they will do from the very beginning. There are some other people who don't. And they keep not knowing what to do for long time. That is fine, and exciting. Just, be aware that there is a Go / No-Go point (I would locate it 3 to 4 weeks from the end) where you **have to decide** what to do. Because if you pass this point, and you still don't decide what to do, you are probably not going to make it.

## Crafting the final project

Crafting your portfolio and your project is more important than you think. You are delivering a public document that will be read by many people. People that you don't even imagine. They know nothing about you. The only way they have to form an opinion about you is by reading your documentation. Your work reflects your personality. If your site is a mess, you are a mess. If it contains typos, you are careless. If the pictures are bad lit, deformed or poorly composed, you don't pay atention to details. If you waste, you are wasteful. Don't let people assume those things about you. Craft your work carefully.

### The documentation

Documenting a project differs slightly from how you document your weekly progress. So far your style has been similar to narrating your journey in a sort of diary. It would be interesting that you also keep a journal of the progress, failures and successes of your final project (like a *making of* page). But this is not what people are expecting to find. They are trying to replicate your project. The information they would like to find is:

* Goal of the project
* Brief story of the idea. The principles or theory behind
* Who has done or attempted this beforehand. You should show your research here
* The different fabrication processes that you have followed. Include as much detail as you captured
* Bill of Materials (BOM)
* The assembly process of the different components
* The testing and programming
* The final result as you are delivering
* Future opportunities of improvements and TODO

And you should carefully organize and format all this information with a table of contents (TOC), headers and all the techniques you have been learning through the course. Do not just dump all the information in an endless page. Keep it neat and elegant, pleasant to the eyes and easy to read.
