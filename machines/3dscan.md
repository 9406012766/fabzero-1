# 3D Scanning and Printing

## General Notes

* File limit set to 1 Mb per file. Check file sizes `du -s * | sort -rn` 1-2 Mb week
* Clean up the archive (remove old unused students folders and files)
* Whatever you 3D print, it must be your own design. It cannot be just downloaded. You can modify another's design though, give credits in this case.

## 3D Scanning

### Individual assignment 2
Scan something using:

* Camera Pictures
* Xbox Kinect

* Try to 3D print your scan
* Try make your own scanner DIY (milk scanner, laser scanner, ...)
