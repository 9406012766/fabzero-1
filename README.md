Fab Zero is a high-density course originally designed to fill knowledge gaps and aimed to prepare students and labs to succeed and improve their experience during [Fab Academy](http://fabacademy.org). Fab Zero is **everything you should know before starting Fab Academy**. It has been also be adapted to prepare Fab Lab Managers. Topics covered include repository management, project documentation, lab preparation, fundamental electronics and programming, design thinking, machine operation, and many more.
