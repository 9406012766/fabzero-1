# The Pre Academy Program

 The Pre Academy is a short crash course under designed to fill knowledge gaps and aimed to prepare students and labs to succeed and improve their experience during [Fab Academy](http://fabacademy.org). It's **everything you should know before starting Fab Academy**. Topics covered include repository management, project documentation, lab preparation, fundamental electronics and programming, design thinking and machine operation.

# First iteration. Pre Academy 2016
The first official cycle of Pre Academy was tutored by Luciano Betoldi and Francisco Sanchez during October and November 2015. The course was taught in the state of Kerala, South India. There were 8 participants in Kochi and 14 in Thiruvananthapuram. The program sillabus and student work was [documented here](http://thebeachlab.github.io/). Successful students obtained a certificate issued by Fab Academy X.

# Second iteration. Pre Academy 2017
This repository hosts the second and current iteration of Pre Academy, which incorporates improved documentation and lessons learned during the follow-up of the pre academy students participating in Fab Academy. Some changes include:
* Adding more design thinking and design principles
* Increasing time spent on documentation tools and repository management
* Increasing lessons in CAD (2D, 3D, parametric, advanced and simulation)
* It is based in commonly used [FOSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software)
* Removing topics that are common with fab academy (composites, molding and casting, electronics production, etc.). It was found that incorporating this subjects paradoxically reduced the attention of the student when taking the Fab Academy program.
