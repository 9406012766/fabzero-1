# Fab Zero Program (formerly Pre Academy)

Fab Zero is a short crash course designed to fill knowledge gaps and aimed to prepare students and labs to succeed and improve their experience during [Fab Academy](http://fabacademy.org). It's **everything you should know before starting Fab Academy**. It can also be adapted to prepare Fab Lab Managers. Topics covered include repository management, project documentation, lab preparation, fundamental electronics and programming, design thinking, machine operation, and health and safety.

This repository hosts the official curriculum of Fab Zero, which incorporates improved documentation and lessons learned during the follow-up of the pre academy students participating in Fab Academy. Some changes include:
* Adding more design thinking and design principles
* Increasing time spent on documentation tools and repository management
* Increasing lessons in CAD (2D, 3D, parametric, advanced and simulation)
* It is now based in commonly used [FOSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software)
* Removing some topics that are common with fab academy
