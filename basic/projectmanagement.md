# Project and time management

## Laws of time
Time has three peculiarities, which I elevated to laws.
* **First** law of time. **Everything consumes time**
* **Second** law of time. **You can't stop time**. There is nothing you can do about it. You can pause but time will not
* **Third** law of time. **Time x Effort = constant**. Given an initial large time to do something, the effort will be low. As time tends to zero, the effort tends to infinite.

## The two mistakes

There are **two mistakes** people make when **managing time**. The **first one** is thinking about it as a continuous, **infinite** line, whose duration is **relative**. Do this and you will always be late. You need to start thinking about time as a physical dimension like length, finite and perfectly measurable.

The **second mistake is overestimating time**. We tend to think, given a deadline, that we have plenty of time to finish a task. This is a big mistake. Let's break down a one week deadline, for example.
* **A week has 5 days**, not 7. Some people affirm they will work 7 days. They fail miserably.
* In any given day you spend 8 hours sleeping, 8 hours in leisure and 8 hours working/studying. The maximum theoretical time you have in a day are 8 hours, which are often splitted in two 4 hours shifts. But this is wrong because of the 3 reasons below.
  * Assume **you will spend 1 hour every shift in emails**, calls, messages, **and the like**. If not more
  * Assume that **an hour is 50 minutes**
  * Assume that **you will take a 30 minutes break** at halfway shifts
* So in reality you have 2h 20 min, lunch break, and another 2h 20 min. That is assuming that you are not a social network addict, in which case reduce further 2 hours a day. And you only have 5 days. To recap, **in a week you have less than 24h of continuous work**. This is the reality.

## Listing all the required tasks
The idea behind project management is simple, to allocate every task in our project in a matrix of time. We only have two uncertains: **the first uncertain is knowing how many pieces we have in the puzzle**. The second uncertain will be how long it will take to complete each task. Sometimes you will forget the first law of time and you will not consider a task, because you think it won't consume a noticeable amount of time. Here are a list of commonly ignored tasks that make your project fail:
* Determining the project management strategy
* Researching
* Lab cleanup
* Documenting
* Multimedia processing
* Testing
* Allocated time for unforeseen
* Troubleshooting and debugging (no, this is not an unforeseen, this is a mathematical certain)
* Rehearshing a presentation

## Assigning time to each task
In project management there are two variants of how to assign time to a task. One is called **demand-side**, in which you start a task and wait until it is completed to continue. You assign time this way for tasks that are out of your control, like the time it takes to a machine for milling a board or to a computer for processing something.

But for things that are under your control -like designing a circuit, or researching for inflatable structures- you don't keep going until you finish. Because you will never finish. Instead you will use the **supply-side** time management, in which you decide beforehand how much time are you going to spend on a task. You do the best you can in that time, and then you stop and switch to the next task. You have to estimate the time (according to your skills) and enforce it. Over time you will become more realistic in your supply-time estimations.

Work backwards from the deadline and forward from current time, iterating until you find a match.

## Parallel vs Serial development
It is important to analize which tasks are independent, so that you can execute them in parallel and which tasks are dependent and you have to wait to start them. Always **throw as many parallel processes as your sanity can handle**. In particular, the **documenting** process should be **always running in parallel**.

## Rescheduling
If you **overestimated time** or **ignored the third law** of time you will probably need to reschedule. It will also be the time to **drop some unrealistic goals** you had in mind. Remember that the most important thing is to deliver.

## Deliver
The only thing certain in project management is that **there is a deadline**. At that day you **have** to deliver. Doesn't matter if it is not what you wanted, if you don't like it, or you are halfway done. That day you deliver, whatever you have. Afterwards, if you want, you can meditate about what changes you should to do in the future to achieve your goals. But remember, you deliver that ugly thing you made. Always. **Deliver**.
