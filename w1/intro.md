# Introduction to Pre Fab Academy. Getting ready

## The notebook
For documentation **it is strongly recommended that you always carry with you a notebook** with around 100 non detachable pages that you will use **exclusively** for the course. Do not use separate sheets because it is highly probable that they will eventually end up lost and shuffled. Screenshots are helpful, but do not rely all your research in screenshots only.

Divide your annotations in entries. In every entry you can write:

* Date and time
* What you are doing, for what assignment (you will forget soon)
* Include machines used and settings
* Include workflows, protocols or procedures you are following
* Include troubles you are finding in the way, and how are you dealing with them
* Include a debugging table if you are debugging
* Finish the entry with a conclusion (Finished, to be continued later, stuck in a process, ...)

> Exercise: Get a notebook for the pre academy program and write down your first entry and answer in one sentence: Why are you here? Please, nothing similar to [this](http://cmorse.org/missiongen/)
