# Introduction to Pre Fab Academy. Getting ready

## The notebook
For documentation **it is strongly recommended that you always carry with you a notebook** with around 100 non detachable pages that you will use **exclusively** for the course. Do not use separate sheets because it is highly probable that they will eventually end up lost and shuffled. Screenshots are helpful, but do not rely all your research in screenshots only.

Divide your annotations in entries. In every entry you can write:

* Date
* What you are doing, for what assignment (you will forget soon)
* Machines used and settings
* Workflows, protocols or procedures you are following
* Troubles you are finding in the  way, and how are you dealing with them
* Debugging table
* Entry conclusion (Finished, to be continued later, stuck in a process, ...)

> Exercise: Get a notebook for the pre fabacademy program and write down your first entry.
